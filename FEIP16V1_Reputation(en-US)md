## General consensus of FEIP

1. FEIP type protocols write data of consensus in OP_RETURN for public witness.

2. The SIGHASH flag of all transaction inputs: ‘ALL’ (value 0x01).

3. The max size of OP_RETURN : 4096 bytes.

4. The format of the data in op_return: JSON.

5. Encoding : utf-8.

6. Since block height `2000000`, any operation of writing to freecash blockchain needs more than `1cd` consumed.


## Consensus of this protocol

1. FEIP16 provides a way for an CID to evaluate other CIDs.
2. Rating someone on chain consumes CoinDays.
3. The rating can be Positive（“+”） or Negative("-"), and The measure unit of an rating is CoinDays. 
4. The quantity of an rating is all the CoinDays Destoryed(CDD) in the transaction.For example: "100 CoinDays Negative rating" can be marked as "-100cd", and "88 CoinDays positive rating" can be marked as "88cd" or "+88cd".
5. The rater is the first input address,and the ratee is the addrsee of the first output other than OP_RETURN output and rater.
6. Anyone can't rate itself.
7. When rating, the field data.cause is used to record the thing causing the rating in format of "object name:object value" , such as "sid:a246f36574f039460063f626f023c2e13a4d184c89279795539be220e9402643".

## OP_RETURN

The OP_RETURN of which contains the data as follows:

|field number|field name|type|content|required|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1|type|String|Fixed: "FEIP"|Y|
|2|sn|int|Serial number<br>Fixed: 16|Y|
|3|ver|int|Fixed: 1|Y|
|4|name|String|Fixed: "Reputation"|N|
|5|pid|string|The PID of this protocol|N|
|6|data.sign|string|must be "+" or "-"|Y|
|7|data.cause|string|The cause of rating. Format: "object name:object value"|N|
